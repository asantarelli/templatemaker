# BrowseGrid — the engine, and the proof it draws

`templates/BrowseGrid/d2grid.c` is a grid drawn with **Direct2D and DirectWrite** into an ordinary
Clarion `REGION`. It holds no data: the Clarion side pushes in the rows that are visible and the grid
draws them, which is exactly the shape an ABC browse queue already has.

## `gridtest` — first light

Attaches to a REGION, sets five columns, pushes a page of made-up rows in and paints:

```
MSBuild gridtest.cwproj /p:ClarionBinPath=C:\clarion12\bin /p:Configuration=Debug
powershell -File shot.ps1 -Exe .\gridtest.exe -Prefix GridTest -Out gridshot.png
```

`docs/BrowseGrid-first-light.png` is the result: a dark header with bold titles, banded rows, gridlines,
a selected row, right-aligned numeric columns, text centred down each row, and a frozen first column.
23 rows fill the region exactly, which is `d2g_PageSize()` answering how many fit.

## What the engine gives Clarion

| call | for |
|---|---|
| `d2g_Available()` | 0 when Direct2D/DirectWrite are missing, so the caller can fall back |
| `d2g_Attach(hwnd, face, pt)` | take over a REGION's window; returns a handle |
| `d2g_Columns` / `d2g_Column` | how many columns, and each one's width, alignment and title |
| `d2g_Frozen(n)` | columns that stay put while the rest scrolls sideways |
| `d2g_Colours(...)` | background, banding, gridlines, text, header, selection |
| `d2g_Page(first, rows)` + `d2g_Cell(row, col, text)` | push the visible page in |
| `d2g_PageSize()` | how many whole rows fit — what to ask the VIEW for |
| `d2g_HitRow` / `d2g_HitCol` | turn a click into a record and a column |
| `d2g_Resize` / `d2g_Repaint` / `d2g_PaintNow` | keep it in step with the window |

## Not built yet

The **template** — dropping this on an existing ABC browse so it takes the LIST's place, driven by the
same `BrowseClass` and VIEW. The engine is deliberately data-free so that binding is a Clarion-side job.
